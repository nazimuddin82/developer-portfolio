                <p>A web developer is a programmer responsible for turning user stories, mockups, and web designs into
                    functional websites. They use web fundamentals such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build, manage,
                    and deploy web applications.</p>

                <p>A junior web developer creates and maintains websites by writing code, troubleshooting and revising
                    code. After a web designer creates a concept for a website's appearance and operation, the web
                    developer transforms that design into a working site.</p>
